# blkstuff
A .blk decryptor and mhy0 extractor for Genshin Impact that doesn't require hooking into the game. Tested working as of 2.0.

The code isn't very good, but it's meant as more of a reference than an actual tool. Any efforts to rewrite the project are highly appreciated.

Also, you'll need a modified AssetStudio to load these files. Since I didn't write it, I won't distribute it here. Sorry.
